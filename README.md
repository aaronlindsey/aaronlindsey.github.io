# Aaron's Personal Website

<https://lindsey.fyi>

I made this as a professional landing page and place to post CTF write-ups. It uses the Jekyll static site generator with some super minimal layouts and styles I developed with inspiration from [jekyll/minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), [chesterhow/tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale/), and [andrewhwanpark/minimal-bootstrap-blog](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/minimal-bootstrap-blog).

Run locally using `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`.
